Dummy maps have their own category on DDNet now. They have been moved from Moderate and Brutal servers.
This type of map requires a tee (dummy) that can't move, hammer and hook, because of deep-freeze, but wisely used and dragged by player will allow him to reach finish line.
Dummy feature is included in <a href="http://ddnet.tw/downloads/">DDNet client</a>.
Enjoy playing these maps: <a href="http://ddnet.tw/ranks/dummy/">Dummy Server</a>.
