<h2 id="mapper-rules">Mapper Rules</h2>
<p>
  Mappers mapping for DDraceNetwork have to follow these rules, or their map will not be accepted:
</p>
<h3>Content</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Be creative!</strong> Do not steal parts or create parts that are very similar to parts on other maps. Instead use your fantasy and create something unique or improve existing parts significantly.</li>
  <li><strong>Make your map fun!</strong> Your map is supposed to be fun for players, not to bore them. Avoid time wasting parts.</li>
  <li>Do something else than simple (stupid) dummy drag parts</li>
  <li>Think about the intended players of your map. A map for moderate should not be a mix of novice and brutal parts. Try to keep the difficulty reasonably homogenous so players don't get bored or frustrated.</li>
  <li>Use faily parts very rarely on novice maps</li>
  <li>Use faily solo parts very rarely on everything else than brutal maps</li>
</ol>
<h3>Design</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Mark every entity the player has to know about with a visible tile.</li>
  <li>Your map's design should have some contrast so it's playable without perfect light conditions. On the other hand the contrast shouldn't be too high or it will be painful to look at.</li>
  <li>The finish line should be reachable from the winner room so a team can finish if the last one dies</li>
</ol>
<p>Make sure your map works, design is done, and when you feel like it's ready for release, <a href="http://forum.ddnet.tw/">send us your map</a>.
