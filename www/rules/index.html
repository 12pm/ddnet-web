<div class="block">
<h2 id="mapper-rules">Mapper Rules</h2>
<p>
  Mappers mapping for DDraceNetwork have to follow these rules, or their map will not be accepted:
</p>
<h3>Content</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Be creative!</strong> Do not steal parts or create parts that are very similar to parts on other maps. Instead use your fantasy and create something unique or improve existing parts significantly.</li>
  <li><strong>Make your map fun!</strong> Your map is supposed to be fun for players, not to bore them. Avoid time wasting parts.</li>
  <li>Do something else than simple (stupid) dummy drag parts</li>
  <li>Think about the intended players of your map. A map for moderate should not be a mix of novice and brutal parts. Try to keep the difficulty reasonably homogenous so players don't get bored or frustrated.</li>
  <li>Use faily parts very rarely on novice maps</li>
  <li>Use faily solo parts very rarely on everything else than brutal maps</li>
  <li>Part balance: When one player has to do a long and hard part, so should the other</li>
</ol>
<h3>Design</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Mark every entity the player has to know about with a visible tile.</li>
  <li>Your map's design should have some contrast so it's playable without perfect light conditions. On the other hand the contrast shouldn't be too high or it will be painful to look at.</li>
  <li>The finish line should be reachable from the winner room so a team can finish if the last one dies</li>
</ol>
<h3>Common problems</h3>
<p>These problems are in many maps, make sure to check for them before you submit your map:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Every image you included in your map is actually used. (used images are green)</li>
  <li>Correct images are embedded into your map. These images are included with every Teeworlds client and therefore do not need to be embedded:<br/>
    <tt>bg_cloud1, bg_cloud2, bg_cloud3, desert_doodads, desert_main, desert_mountains, desert_mountains2, desert_sun, generic_deathtiles, generic_unhookable, grass_doodads, grass_main, jungle_background, jungle_deathtiles, jungle_doodads, jungle_main, jungle_midground, jungle_unhookables, moon, mountains, snow, stars, sun, winter_doodads, winter_main, winter_mountains, winter_mountains2, winter_mountains3</tt><br/>
    All other images must be embedded.</li>
  <li>Layers should not be too big. Big game layers (game, front, tele, speedup, switch, tune) use up resources on servers. All big layers use up resources on clients. When your map is finished make the layers as small as possible. (but don't cut off any part)</li>
  <li>You may want to mark some layers as detail-layers, so that players who prefer to play minimalistically have the choice to do so (HD off). Some graphics cards are too weak for HD on some maps.</li>
  <li>Make sure there are no empty layers and groups.</li>
  <li>The background needs to be big enough for all screen sizes. Use the "Proof" button in the editor to check what players will see.</li>
  <li>Don't place teleporter destination tiles directly on the ground. When two players are teleported, the second one is violently thrown away.</li>
</ol>
<p>Make sure your map works, design is done, common problems are solved, and when you feel like it's ready for release, <a href="http://forum.ddnet.tw/">send us your map</a>.
